**reddit_scrape.py**

This file utilizes praw to scrape all submissions from a given subreddit. This uses random sampling to obtain submissions from a wide range of dates. This was done instead of full scraping due to time constraints.

**reddit_compile.py**

Compiles csv's generated by the reddit_scrape.py script into a single csv. Also performs some simple filtering and text concatenation to ensure consistency.
