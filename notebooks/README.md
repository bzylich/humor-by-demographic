gabriel-olid-davidson.ipynb:
This notebook was used to train single models for the fourth task (offensiveness score). In it you will find cells that initialize and train models, and run them on our test data and the competition dev data. The models can be pretrained on the olid and davidson datasets or not, depending on which cell you run. All of the models and training in here are based on the huggingface-transformers "Trainer" class and related classes, so refer to their documentation to better understand what is happening.
